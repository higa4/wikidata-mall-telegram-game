    You can close a shop in order to have space for a new shop.
    Getting rid of a shop will gain you some money.
    You should sell all the items currently in stock before closing your shop as they will be lost on closing the shop.
    Also people currently working in the shop will leave with it.
    (You can take them from the shop before closing it.)
    Make sure to skill the collector skill first as you will keep the benefit even after closing the shop.

    One special skill is the collector.
    In contrast to the other skills you can skill it per shop you own.
    The total level will influence your throughput per item.
    This includes the levels for shops you don't even own anymore.
    The skill queue will allow you to add skills which starts within 12 hours.
    You can also reset your skill queue (but not the one currently in training).
