    Here you can see statistics about this bot.


    First there are the amounts of data used from wikidata.

    You can view all the players based on their return on interest or their total collector skill level.
  product: >
    This is a product you can sell.

    When you restock items will get sold over time.
    Make sure there are always items in stock.
    This way you can get income all the time.


    Hire employees to improve purchasing and selling prices or skill something.
    In order to improve the throughput per item skill the collector skill.
  settings: >
    Change the language and enable / disable helpful explations where numbers come from
  shop-closure: >
    You can close a shop in order to have space for a new shop.
    Getting rid of a shop will gain you some money.


    You should sell all the items currently in stock before closing your shop as they will be lost on closing the shop.

    Also people currently working in the shop will leave with it.
    (You can take them from the shop before closing it.)


    Make sure to skill the collector skill first as you will keep the benefit even after closing the shop.
  shop-employees: >
    You can select employees for your shop.

    When you have an employee with a fitting hobby (the same as the shop they are working in) they will be much better suited for their job. 💚
  shop: >
    This is a shop of yours.
    You can add products to sell or hire employees.


    Closing a shop is also possible.
    You will get some money for closing it.
  shops-construction: >
    You can select one of these randomly selected shops as your next shop.
    With it you can do all the things you like.
    Choose wisely and get rich 🙃
  shops: >
    Here are all your shiny shops. ✨
  skills: >
    All the skills you can learn.
    And you will only need time for that.
    Nothing else.


    Skills will improve a certain thing.
    You can guess what a skill might do as its emoji is fitting to their field of improvement.


    Keep in mind we are using 📎 as our currency.
    Some skills and tools might come in handy when handling these. 🙃


    One special skill is the collector.
    In contrast to the other skills you can skill it per shop you own.
    The total level will influence your throughput per item.
    This includes the levels for shops you don't even own anymore.


    The skill queue will allow you to add skills which starts within 12 hours.
    You can also reset your skill queue (but not the one currently in training).
